4. **Can you explain the difference between global and local package installation in npm?**
   - **Answer:** Local packages are installed in the project's directory and are accessible only within that project. Global packages are installed system-wide and can be used across multiple projects. Use `npm install -g <package-name>` to install a package globally.

5. **What are some common security concerns with npm packages, and how can they be mitigated?**
   - **Answer:** Security concerns include malicious code within packages or vulnerabilities due to outdated dependencies. Mitigation strategies involve regularly updating packages, auditing dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, and carefully reviewing packages before adding them to a project.

6. **How does npm handle versioning, and what is semantic versioning?**
   - **Answer:** npm uses semantic versioning (semver) to manage package versions. Semantic versioning follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, indicating backward-incompatible changes, backward-compatible new features, and backward-compatible bug fixes, respectively.

7. **What is the role of `npx` in the Node.js ecosystem?**
   - **Answer:** `npx` is a tool that comes with npm (version 5.2.0 and above) and allows the execution of binaries from npm packages. It enables running commands without globally installing the package, which is useful for one-time uses or testing.

8. **How can you update a package to its latest version using npm?**
   - **Answer:** To update a package, use `npm update <package-name>`. To update a global package, add the `-g` flag. For updating all packages to their latest versions, you might use tools like `npm-check-updates`.

9. **What is a peer dependency in npm, and when would you use it?**
   - **Answer:** A peer dependency specifies that a package is compatible with a particular version of another package, but doesn't directly include it. It's used when developing packages that extend or plug into others, ensuring compatibility without duplicating dependencies.

10. **How do you handle conflicting dependencies in npm?**
    - **Answer:** Conflicting dependencies can be managed by resolving version discrepancies, using tools like `npm dedupe` to simplify dependency trees, or manually adjusting the `package.json` to align versions. In complex cases, containerization or module bundlers can help isolate dependencies.

Understanding npm's functionalities and best practices is essential for efficient and secure JavaScript development, enabling developers to build robust applications by leveraging a vast ecosystem of packages.

**10 Interview Questions and Answers:**

1.  **Q: What is NPM, and why is it essential for JavaScript development?**
    * **A:** NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It simplifies the process of installing, managing, and using external libraries and tools (packages). It's essential because it allows developers to reuse existing code, saving time and effort, and ensuring consistency across projects. In real world, it keeps projects from reinventing the wheel.
2.  **Q: How do you install a package using NPM? Provide an example.**
    * **A:** You use the `npm install <package-name>` command in the command line. For example, to install the "lodash" utility library, you would run `npm install lodash`. This downloads the package and adds it to your project's "node\_modules" folder and also updates your package-lock.json file.
3.  **Q: What is the purpose of the `package.json` file?**
    * **A:** The `package.json` file is a manifest file that contains metadata about your project, including dependencies, scripts, and project information. It allows others to understand and replicate your project's setup. In real world it allows for consistent build process across teams.
4.  **Q: What is the `node_modules` folder, and why is it often excluded from version control?**
    * **A:** The `node_modules` folder contains all the installed packages and their dependencies. It's often excluded from version control (like Git) because it can be very large, and it can be easily recreated by running `npm install`. This keep repository sizes small.
5.  **Q: Explain the difference between `npm install --save` and `npm install --save-dev`.**
    * **A:** `npm install --save` (or `npm install`) adds the package as a runtime dependency, meaning it's required for the application to function. `npm install --save-dev` adds the package as a development dependency, meaning it's only needed during development (e.g., testing, linting). This allows for smaller production builds.
6.  **Q: What is the purpose of the `package-lock.json` file?**
    * **A:** The `package-lock.json` file locks down the exact versions of all installed packages, ensuring consistent installations across different environments. This prevents unexpected issues caused by version mismatches. In real world this prevents the "works on my machine" problem.
7.  **Q: How do you update a package to the latest version using NPM?**
    * **A:** You can use the `npm update <package-name>` command. This will update the specified package to its latest compatible version based on the version ranges specified in your `package.json` file.
8.  **Q: What are NPM scripts, and how are they used?**
    * **A:** NPM scripts are custom commands defined in the "scripts" section of the `package.json` file. They allow you to automate tasks like building, testing, and starting your application. For example, you might define a "start" script that runs `node server.js`.
9.  **Q: What are global packages, and when should you use them?**
    * **A:** Global packages are installed in a system-wide location, making them accessible from any directory. They are typically used for command-line tools that you want to use across multiple projects. Examples include `npm install -g typescript`. Use them for development tools, not for dependancies of a project.
10. **Q: How would you handle a situation where an `npm install` command is failing due to dependency conflicts?**
    * **A:** First, I would check the error messages for clues about the conflicting packages. I would then try the following:
        * Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file and run `npm install` again.
        * Use `npm outdated` to identify outdated packages and update them.
        * Manually resolve version conflicts in the `package.json` file.
        * If all else fails, I would search for solutions online or consult with other developers.
