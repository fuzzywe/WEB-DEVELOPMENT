1. What is Node.js and Where can you use it?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client‚Äôs browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.
2. Why use Node.js?

Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:

    It is generally fast
    It rarely blocks
    It offers a unified programming language and data type
    Everything is asynchronous 
    It yields great concurrency

3. How does Node.js work?

A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Let‚Äôs explore this flow of operations in detail.

Node.js Architecture Workflow

    Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:
    Querying for data
    Deleting data 
    Updating the data
    Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
    The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources
    The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients

A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.
5. If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the Single-Threaded Event Loop Model. The Node JS Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.
6. Explain callback in Node.js.

A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking.  Being an asynchronous platform, Node.js heavily relies on callback. All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks.
7. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

    The control flow of asynchronous logic is more specified and structured.
    The coupling is low.
    We've built-in error handling.
    Improved readability.

88. What do you understand about ESLint?

ESLint is a popular open-source tool that is used to analyze and flag errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.
89. Define the concept of the test pyramid. Please explain the process of implementing them in terms of HTTP APIs.

The test pyramid is a concept that is often used in software testing to illustrate the ideal distribution of different types of tests. The pyramid has three layers: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The idea is that most tests should be at the unit level, with fewer tests at the integration and end-to-end levels.

To implement the test pyramid in terms of HTTP APIs, you can start by writing unit tests for each endpoint in the API. These tests should focus on testing the functionality of the endpoint in isolation without making any external requests or dependencies. Once the unit tests are passed, you can write integration tests that test the interaction between different endpoints and components in the API. Finally, you can write end-to-end tests that test the entire API, from the user interface to the database.
90. How does Node.js handle the child threads?

Node.js handles child threads by creating separate instances of the Node.js runtime environment that can be used to execute code in parallel with the main process.

In Node.js, events are a core part of the platform, and they are used to handle asynchronous operations.
92. How to Enhance Node.js Performance through Clustering?

Clustering can be used to improve the performance of HTTP servers, database connections, and other I/O operations. However, it is important to note that clustering does not guarantee a linear increase in performance.
93. What is a thread pool, and which library handles it in Node.js?

A thread pool is a collection of threads that are used to execute tasks in parallel. In Node.js, the thread pool is handled by the libuv library, which is a multi-platform support library that provides asynchronous I/O operations.
94. How are worker threads different from clusters?

Worker threads and clusters are two different approaches to leveraging the power of multiple CPUs in Node.js. While clusters create multiple instances of a Node.js process, each running on a separate CPU core, worker threads provide a way to create multiple threads within a single process.
95. How to measure the duration of async operations?

The console.time and console.timeEnd methods allow you to measure the duration of a block of code. The console.time method starts the timer and the console.timeEnd method stops the timer and logs the duration to the console.

The performance.now method provides a more precise way to measure the duration of async operations. It returns the current timestamp in milliseconds, which can be used to calculate the duration of a task. 
96. How to measure the performance of async operations?

You can use several tools and techniques to measure performance, including using the built-in --prof flag, the perf tool, and third-party libraries like benchmark.js.
97. What are the types of streams available in Node.js?

Four types of streams are available in Node.js, including readable, writable, duplex, and transform streams. 
98. What is meant by tracing in Node.js?

Tracing is a technique used in Node.js to profile the performance of an application. It involves recording the function calls and events that occur during the execution of the application and analyzing the data to identify performance bottlenecks. 
99. Where is package.json used in Node.js?

The package.json file is located in the root directory of an application and the npm package manager uses it to install and manage the dependencies of an application.
100. What is the difference between readFile and create Read Stream in Node.js?

Create Read Stream is a better option for reading large files, while the read file is a better option for small files. It is important to choose the right method based on the file size and the application's requirements.

103. How to get information about a file in Node.js?

In Node.js, the fs module provides methods for working with the file system. To get information about a file, you can use the fs. stat() method. The fs. stat() method returns an object that contains information about the file, such as the file size, creation date, and modified date.
104. How does the DNS lookup function work in Node.js?

In Node.js, the DNS module provides methods for performing DNS lookups. DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. The DNS. lookup() method is used to perform a DNS lookup and resolve a domain name into an IP address.
105. What is the difference between setImmediate() and setTimeout()?

The setTimeout() method schedules code execution after a specified delay, measured in milliseconds. On the other hand, the setImmediate() method schedules code execution to occur immediately after the current event loop iteration completes. This means that setImmediate() has a higher priority than setTimeout().
106. Explain the concept of Punycode in Node.js.
