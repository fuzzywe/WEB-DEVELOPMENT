Here are **100 Node.js interview questions and answers**, categorized from **basic to advanced**:

---

## **Basic Questions (1-25)**
### **1. What is Node.js?**  
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside the browser, built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine.

### **2. Why is Node.js single-threaded?**  
Node.js follows the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model using an event loop to handle multiple requests efficiently on a single thread.

### **3. What is the V8 engine?**  
V8 is Googleâ€™s high-performance JavaScript engine that compiles JavaScript directly to machine code for faster execution.

### **4. What is the purpose of `require()` in Node.js?**  
`require()` is used to import external modules, JSON files, or local files into a Node.js application.

### **5. What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?**  
CommonJS (`require()`) is used in Node.js, while ES Modules (`import/export`) are the standard for JavaScript but require `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.

### **6. How do you install Node.js?**  
Download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org) or use a package manager (`brew install node` for Mac, `choco install nodejs` for Windows).

### **7. What is NPM? How is it different from Yarn?**  
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. Yarn is an alternative with better performance and security features.

### **8. How do you check the installed Node.js version?**  
Run `node -v` or `npm -v` in the terminal.

### **9. How do you create a simple server in Node.js?**  
```javascript
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write("Hello, World!");
  res.end();
});
server.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

### **10. What is a callback function in Node.js?**  
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, executed after the completion of an asynchronous operation.

### **11. What is the event loop in Node.js?**  
The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and message queue, handling asynchronous operations efficiently.

### **12. What is the difference between `setTimeout()` and `setImmediate()`?**  
- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` executes after a minimum delay.
- `setImmediate(fn)` executes immediately after the I/O phase in the event loop.

### **13. What is an event emitter in Node.js?**  
An event emitter is a pattern in Node.js where objects can emit and listen to events.  
Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on('greet', () => console.log('Hello!'));
emitter.emit('greet');
```

### **14. What are streams in Node.js?**  
Streams are objects that let you read/write data efficiently. Example: `fs.createReadStream()` reads a file in chunks.

### **15. What are the different types of streams in Node.js?**  
1. Readable Streams (e.g., file reading)
2. Writable Streams (e.g., file writing)
3. Duplex Streams (e.g., socket communication)
4. Transform Streams (e.g., compression)

### **16. What is the purpose of `process` in Node.js?**  
The `process` object provides information about the current running Node.js process.

### **17. What is `__dirname` in Node.js?**  
`__dirname` returns the absolute path of the directory containing the current script.

### **18. What is `__filename` in Node.js?**  
`__filename` returns the absolute path of the current script file.

### **19. How do you read and write files in Node.js?**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('test.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!');
console.log(fs.readFileSync('test.txt', 'utf8'));
```

### **20. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations?**  
- Synchronous operations (`fs.readFileSync`) block code execution until the task completes.
- Asynchronous operations (`fs.readFile`) use callbacks/promises and allow the rest of the code to execute.

### **21. How do you handle errors in Node.js?**  
By using try-catch for synchronous errors and `.catch()` for promises.

---

## **Intermediate Questions (22-50)**
### **22. What is the difference between `fs.readFile()` and `fs.createReadStream()`?**  
- `fs.readFile()` loads the entire file into memory.  
- `fs.createReadStream()` reads the file in chunks (efficient for large files).

### **23. What is middleware in Express.js?**  
Middleware functions modify request/response objects before reaching the route handler.

### **24. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH` in REST API?**  
- `PUT` replaces the entire resource.  
- `PATCH` updates only specific fields.

### **25. How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?**  
Using `multer` package:
```javascript
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
```

```javascript
db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", [username]);
```

### **58. What is GraphQL? How is it different from REST?**  
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows fetching only the required data, unlike REST which sends fixed responses.

### **59. What is the difference between `socket.io` and WebSockets?**
